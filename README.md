# 🧠 Cognitive Load Reducer
A vibe-coded mobile app for turning everyday chaos into clarity.

### Overview
Cognitive Load Reducer is a mobile app designed to cut through everyday mental clutter. Using AI, the app analyzes photos, screenshots, or voice notes and breaks them into four actionable categories:

- Decisions you need to make
- Information you’ll need later
- Details you can safely ignore
- Tasks you can offload or automate

The goal: transform scattered inputs into clear, structured insights that reduce cognitive load and help users stay focused.

This project was created as my first vibe-coding experiment—building iteratively and intuitively with AI-assisted development rather than following a strict blueprint.

### Features

- AI Integration: Google Generative AI (Gemini API)
- Local Storage: Room database

### Why I Built This
Cognitive overload is something most of us face every day. As a project manager exploring more technical and creative work, I wanted to build something that blends:

- Productivity
- Human-centered design
- Generative AI
- Learn-by-doing experimentation

This app represents my growing interest in AI-assisted development and how humans can partner with AI to build meaningful tools that are faster, more creative, and with less friction.
