# Cognitive Load Reducer
A vibe-coded mobile app for turning everyday chaos into clarity.

## Overview
Cognitive Load Reducer is a mobile app designed to cut through everyday mental clutter. Using AI, the app analyzes photos, screenshots, or voice notes and breaks them into four actionable categories:

- Decisions you need to make
- Information you’ll need later
- Details you can safely ignore
- Tasks you can offload or automate

The goal: transform scattered inputs into clear, structured insights that reduce cognitive load and help users stay focused.

This project was created as my first vibe-coding experiment—building iteratively and intuitively with AI-assisted development rather than following a strict blueprint.
